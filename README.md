Mern Stack and Docker

This is a example of a Containerized Mern Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with an authenticated dashboard for user monitoring tools and Custom Components. I'm creating this example for a tutorial I'll post in my channel.

(I will update this repository Weekly, so this way i wll have time to my other projects )

Stack (Until now):

Express: { JsonWebToken, hapi/joi, winston (for log persistence), bcrypt, dotenv }

React: { react-router-dom, RxJs, NobbleWallet },

Docker-compose, mongo-db;
