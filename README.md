Mern Stack and Docker

This is a example of a Containerized Mern Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with an authenticated dashboard for user monitoring tools and Custom Components. I'm creating this example for a tutorial I'll post in my channel.

If you wanna run you will just need a mongodb without password running on 27017

# yarn install
# yarn run server
# yarn run client
